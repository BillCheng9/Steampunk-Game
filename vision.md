## Target Audience
The game is targeted towards a young adult audience who enjoys playing RPG games

## Value
Most RPGs are high fantasy - this one will explore the more niche genre of steampunk. The story is of a manufacturing
line robot that was thrown away after defects in its system were detected. General theme of anti-capitalism.

## Features
They are able to fight AI-controlled characters, shop for items and services, level-up, and choose from a plethora of options in the story with random events changing how the story unravels. The game will have a GUI that complements the game and makes navigating easier for the player and allows them to visualize the story. The biggest constraint is implementing a good UI system and not having time to create a fully fleshed out story with different plot points.
